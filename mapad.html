Dear Mr. Andrews,
<br>
<br>
I’m writing to resign from my position as customer service representative, effective September 16, 2022.
<br>

I’ve recently decided to go back to school, and my program starts in late September. I’m tendering my resignation now so that I can be as helpful as possible to you during the transition.
<br>

I’ve truly enjoyed my time working with you and everyone else on our team at LMK. It’s rare to find a customer service role that offers as much opportunity to grow and learn, and perhaps more rare to find such a positive, inspiring team of people to grow and learn with.
<br>

I’m particularly grateful for your guidance while I was considering furthering my education. Your support has meant so much to me. 
<br>

Please let me know if there’s anything I can do to help you find and train my replacement.
<br>
<br>
Thanks and best wishes,
<br>

Signature (hard copy letter)
<br>

Nicole Thomas
